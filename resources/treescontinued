## Summary and Key Concepts of Binary Tree Traversals and Types

### Binary Trees

A **binary tree** is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child.

### Binary Search Trees (BST)

- **Definition**: A binary tree where the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- **Usage**: Efficient searching and sorting operations.
- **Node Structure**:
    ```java
    class BSTNode {
        int data;
        BSTNode left;  // Values less than data
        BSTNode right; // Values greater than data
    }
    ```

### AVL Trees

- **Definition**: A self-balancing binary search tree where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one.
- **Key Characteristics**:
    - Maintains balance using rotations.
    - Ensures O(log n) time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion.
- **Node Structure**:
    ```java
    class AVLNode {
        int data;
        int height;
        AVLNode left;
        AVLNode right;
    }
    ```

### Red-Black Trees

- **Definition**: A self-balancing binary search tree where each node has an extra bit for denoting the color of the node, red or black.
- **Properties**:
    - Root is always black.
    - Red nodes cannot have red children.
    - Every path from a node to its descendant null nodes has the same number of black nodes.
- **Node Structure**:
    ```java
    class RBNode {
        int data;
        boolean color; // true for red, false for black
        RBNode left, right, parent;
    }
    ```

### B-Trees

- **Definition**: A self-balancing tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.
- **Usage**: Commonly used in databases and file systems.
- **Node Structure**:
    ```java
    class BTreeNode {
        int[] keys;
        int t; // Minimum degree
        BTreeNode[] children;
        int n; // Current number of keys
        boolean leaf;
    }
    ```

### Tries (Prefix Trees)

- **Definition**: A tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set where the keys are usually strings.
- **Usage**: Efficient retrieval of strings in a dataset.
- **Node Structure**:
    ```java
    class TrieNode {
        TrieNode[] children = new TrieNode[26]; // For lowercase letters 'a' to 'z'
        boolean isEndOfWord;
    }
    ```

### Heaps

- **Definition**: A special tree-based data structure satisfying the heap property; in a max heap, for any given node, the value is greater than its children.
- **Usage**: Implementing priority queues.
- **Node Structure**: Typically represented as arrays for efficient indexing.

By understanding these tree types, their structures, and traversal methods, one can choose the appropriate data structure for efficient data management and operations in Java.
